        <p class="instructions" style="padding-top:25px;">Step 1: Place a pizza stone in oven and preheat oven to 500 F degrees. Allow the pizza stone to preheat for at least 30 minutes.</p>
        <p class="instructions">Step 2: To make the sauce: Drain the liquid form the tomatoes and transfer to a blender, pulse 3 or 4 times until the tomatoes are pureed. Stir in the garlic and olive oil. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Set aside.</p>
        <p class="instructions">Step 3: To make the pizza: Once your stone is preheated, dust work surface with flour to roll out your dough. This recipes makes 2 12-inch or 4 8-inch pizzas, so be sure to split the dough accordingly. Flatten the dough to a thin round.</p>
        <p class="instructions">Step 4: Dust a pizza peel with cornmeal and place the dough round on the peel. Give the peel a little shake to make sure that the dough moves freely and is not sticking. Brush the dough with olive oil and lightly coat dough with tomato sauce, leaving Â½ inch exposed around the edge. Top with cheeses, oregano and sea salt (to taste).</p>
        <p class="instructions">Step 5: Open the oven and slide the pizza off the peel on to the pizza stone. Allow pizza to cook until the crust is golden brown and crisp and the cheese is bubbling.</p>
        <p class="instructions">Step 6: Remove the pizza from the oven and place on a cutting board. Let pizza rest for 1-2 minutes before you cut it. Repeat process with remaining dough.</p>
